~Many modern websites use CORS to allow access from subdomains and trusted third parties.
 Their implementation of CORS may contain mistakes or be overly lenient to ensure that 
 everything works, and this can result in exploitable vulnerabilities.

Set HTTP headers in order to attach metadata about the data or payload,to control about
the information like this.

for HTTP request methods that can cause side-effects on server data (in particular, 
    HTTP methods other than GET, or POST with certain MIME types), the specification 
    mandates that browsers "preflight" the request, soliciting supported methods from 
    the server with the HTTP OPTIONS request method, and then, upon "approval" from the 
    server, sending the actual request. Servers can also inform clients whether
     "credentials" (such as Cookies and HTTP Authentication) should be sent with requests.
